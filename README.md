We trying to make shopping more convenient and faster. Establish communication bridge for shops with each client. 
We make a mobile app with which you can make purchases at any store, book, reserve products, pay online, keep track of purchases, and track your family.

Imagine, you open the app, select your nearest shop with help of GPS, watch range, select, order and pay. You get a check in the form QR-code.  Go to the store and get the order. On the way your chat with the store sales manager.

For sellers it is a single sales platform, a new convenient and efficient way to analyze sales and customer information, planning tools, communicating with customers.
We will earn money from each purchase or from subscription of stores.
Our team is young but very purposeful.
Now we work on depth survey and develop prototype.
